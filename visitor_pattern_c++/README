IMPORTANT :

To compile this source code on any reasonable UNIX or UNIX-like
platform (including Macintosh OS X, and even some Androids...),
simply run

	'make clean && make test'

with current working directory being the directory containing the
'Makefile' file (this is assuming 'g++' is available for compiling
the source code).

That's all. The name of the executable should be 'test'

After that one can just run './test' to see the output

One can also modify the CFLAG in the 'Makefile' to enable debugging
output

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile this source code on MS Windows, import all .cc files and
.h files into some IDE, and then click a button that says 'compile'
(you may need to rename all .cc files to .cpp files, IDK...)
Also your mileage may vary.

(BTW I'm NOT a Windows user)
